# Project Description & Progress

The project aims to efficiently control the speed of a DC motor by adjusting the input voltage and current based on real-time feedback from the motor's encoder.

- A three-phase half-wave rectifier converts the AC supply into pulsating DC.
- The microcontroller regulates this DC and adjusts the firing angles of thyristors.
- Encoder feedback ensures precise speed measurement and control.

**Applications:** Robotics, industrial automation, and electric vehicles.
